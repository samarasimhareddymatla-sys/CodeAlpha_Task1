Credit Scoring Model – CodeAlpha Task 1

Project Overview :

This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship at CodeAlpha.
The objective of the project is to predict an individual’s creditworthiness using historical financial data such as income, debts, and payment history.

The model classifies whether a person is likely to be creditworthy or not, helping financial institutions make better lending decisions.

Features :

Data preprocessing and feature engineering from financial data

Classification model using Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest

Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

Deployment-ready code for real-world use

 Tech Stack :

Python 3

Pandas, Logisitic regression, RandomForest

Scikit-learn (for ML models and metrics)
